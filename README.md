## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🖥️ How It Works

1️⃣ **Typing Text** - When the user types, the previous text is stored in the **Undo Stack**.  
2️⃣ **Undo Action** - Moves the last state from **Undo Stack** to **Redo Stack** and restores the previous state.  
3️⃣ **Redo Action** - Moves the last state from **Redo Stack** back to **Undo Stack** and applies it again.  
4️⃣ **Stack Visualization** - Displays live updates of **Undo & Redo Stacks**.  
5️⃣ **Animations** - The text editor, stack updates, and buttons are animated for a smooth user experience.
